## Description

* Starter codes of HTML file has been provided with some errors when the console is opened.



## Action

1. Created a weather dashboard with form inputs.

2. Used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. The link take us to a guide on how to use the 5 Day Forecast API. Registered for an API key in order to use this API. After registering for a new API key, waited upto 2 hours for that API key to activate.

3. Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, we need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name.

4. Used `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

5. It adapts to multiple screen sizes.

6. The following points show how the app should works:
    * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

    * The search history is displayed below the search button with a clear button to clear the search history.

    * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
        * The city name
        * The date
        * An icon representation of weather conditions
        * The temperature
        * The wind speed
        * The humidity
        

    * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
        * The date
        * An icon representation of weather conditions
        * The temperature
        * The wind speed
        * The humidity
  
    * When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

7. The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
